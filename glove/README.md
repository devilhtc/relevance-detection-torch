### Glove embedding

Download the embedding from the glove [official site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and put the embeddings in `glove` in this directory.

e.g. the directory tree would be like (after downloading the first option *Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5*)
```
- top dir (of this repo)
    - glove
        - README.md (this file)
        - loader.py
        - glove
            - glove.6B.50d.txt
            - glove.6B.100d.txt
            - glove.6B.200d.txt
            - glove.6B.300d.txt
```
